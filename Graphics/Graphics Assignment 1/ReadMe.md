Below are links to my reproductions of the examples assigned to Graphics Assignment #1. This folder contains the code to all the reproductions.

Example 2: https://annabellekanch.github.io/CSC2463/Graphics/Graphics%20Assignment%201/Example%202/index.html 

Example 3: https://annabellekanch.github.io/CSC2463/Graphics/Graphics%20Assignment%201/Example%203/index.html

Example 4: https://annabellekanch.github.io/CSC2463/Graphics/Graphics%20Assignment%201/Example%204/index.html

To complete this assignment I used P5.js's references to aid in the creation of my reproductions 
so they could mimic the examples closely. I also utilized Visual Studio Code to host and write my code. 

Folders:
Example 1
    lime green background with a circle and square.
Example 2
    triple venn diagram to display primary colors
Example 3
    Pacman & red ghost 
Example 4
    red star inside of green circle on a blue background
